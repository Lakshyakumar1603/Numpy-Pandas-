arrary
numpy : create the arrary on the python 
continous memory allocation
homogenous 
collection of items
python list are alternative of array
coustimzed version of arrary 

drawback of list :
1.slowed 
block of memory requested
continous memory allocation
python list are dynamic
refrestial arrary concept 
gernal purpose 

type of arrary : 
static : size fixed ,memory losses 
dynamic : size variable it can be change,data type is fixed,
sifting opreation,bulk of arrary,memory watage is more,faster than static 
  
refreance aarary :data type ,multiple type data items stores(int,float,bool,char)
space proirty 
memory stores 
stores memory addres in another arrary
memory watage 
another arrary created the arrary 
doble memory wate
sapce complexity 
time complexity 
computation incresed

numpy : to create the arrary 
unsized integewer
